Netsoc server setup scripts


These are scripts to setup services/daemons/whatever 

List of services 

Finished:
*ssh server  (includes banner and allowed users/groups setup)
*ldap client (run on servers you want to enable logging in with ldap on)
*ldap server
*web-wordpress (main website www.netsoc.dit.ie)

Working on:
*web-forum
*Firewall 

Planned:
*web-wiki 
 -(see mediawiki-test branch) - mediawiki is not final solution
*dns server
 - we have a separate repo for bind. The reason for this being that we can make changes on
  the server and push up without trying to push to the main serversetup repo.
