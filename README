Netsoc server setup scripts


PLEASE NOTE!
******************************************************************
For code that runs a public service or people interact with, i definitely
agree that proper/standardised methods are a reuirement however 
these scripts are supposed to be quick hackjobs that only we run
These scripts are hackish and nasty and are guaranteed to make you
cry. Please don't take this as an indication of how we normally code
that runs public services

******************************************************************



These are scripts to setup services/daemons/whatever
